The documentary *Downloaded* tells of the rise and fall of Napster. This early noughties app enabled millions of worldwide users to share their files. The network failed when its central hub, the Napster company, was defeated in a legal dispute over copyright infringement.

The lesson was clear; centralised networks are vulnerable to lawsuits. Users quickly switched to [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent), a decentralised file-sharing network with no central points of failure. Although website gateways to the torrent protocol suffer occasional DDoS or legal attack - the most famous example being The Pirate Bay - the torrent network retains an estimated quarter billion users nearly 15 years after its invention. 

## Lessons Learned
Satoshi Nakomoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, clearly learnt the above lessons well. Previous efforts to create software-based money, such as [E-gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold), failed for the same reason as Napster. But by cracking the [Byzantine Generals](http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09997.html) computer science problem, Satoshi built his digital monetary solution on a solid, decentralised foundation. No government, fearful of the challenge to its money-creation monopoly, could shut down Bitcoin in court. There was no company to sue and no identifiable creator to pressure, just open-source code spreading like wildfire across the internet.

This wise design decision, combined with the [economic incentive to support and expand the network through mining](/kb/what-is-bitcoin-mining/), allowed Bitcoin sufficient time to bootstrap itself as a network. Now a global technological and economic phenomenon, whose combined hardware investment makes it the world’s most powerful computing network, Bitcoin is a major challenge for any government to block at the network level. As Bitcoin network traffic can be easily re-routed, any such blockade would be a constant struggle to maintain and would inflict tremendous “collateral damage” on regular internet usage. 


## Mining
That said, the Bitcoin network’s open nature means that governments can participate in mining. Should a nation state wish to sabotage the network, it would first need to purchase sufficient hardware to exceed the computing power of all existing, honest miners. This is known as a [51% attack](http://en.bitcoinwiki.org/Bitcoin_weaknesses#51.25_attack); it allows a successful attacker to issue fraudulent transactions (“double spends”), lock out honest miners and block the transactions of other users. The cost to mount such an attack is hard to estimate as [mining difficulty](https://blockchain.info/charts/difficulty?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=) rises, mining technology advances and the supply of necessary hardware fluctuates. The lower bound is roughly estimated at $100 million, plus the on-going electricity cost to maintain the attack. 

However, while Bitcoin could be degraded or destroyed by a 51% attack, it wouldn’t work as a takeover strategy. A 51% attack is impossible to disguise so users would abandon Bitcoin in response. The attacker would end up owning an empty, discredited shell. There are also [defensive measures](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/4-lines-defence-51-attack/) the network could implement against a 51% attack, making its ultimate outcome uncertain.

Indirect attempts to assume control of the Bitcoin network are a more complex problem. The development of mining pools, unforeseen by Satoshi, has led to a somewhat concerning degree of network ownership by a handful of pool owners. The top three pools constitute over 50% of mining power, [although this distribution](https://blockchain.info/pools) varies constantly. The corruption or coercion of pool owners seems a cheaper and more effective means of government takeover or attack. However, if such subversion of pools was discovered, leaked or even suspected; it’s likely that most miners would quickly redeploy their individual mining power into untainted pools. Miners have an economic incentive to maintain an honest network as the alternative, once discovered, would crash the value of Bitcoin and thus destroy the value of their business investment and accumulated bitcoins. 

## Regulation
Governmental attempts to build legislative frameworks around the Bitcoin economy represent a more credible threat to Bitcoin’s intended function as a decentralised and permissionless money system. The New York [BitLicense](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/beware-bitlicense-new-yorks-virtual-currency-regulations-invade-privacy-and-hamper), intended to bring Bitcoin exchanges into compliance with [AML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering#Enforcement), [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) and other standards common to banks, produced the unintended consequence of causing 15 Bitcoin companies to leave that jurisdiction. This goes to highlight the fact that legislation or an outright ban (such [as Russia](http://cryptogazette.com/russia-prison-for-being-involved-with-bitcoin/) is considering) by one nation or region achieves little against Bitcoin’s global reach. 

By [allying](http://blockchainalliance.org/) with compliant exchanges, businesses and miners, the state is able to create a database of Bitcoin address ownership as a prelude to implementing blacklists. Coins may become “tainted” through association with illegal activities, which presents a risk to [Bitcoin’s fungibility](/kb/why-bitcoin-is-good-money/), whereby “clean” coins are worth more than “dirty” coins. Such measures likely inconvenience casual users more than they limit sophisticated users, who are able to obfuscate their “trail.” Further, if one skips compliant exchanges and trades Bitcoin peer to peer - whether online or in person - there is little threat of surveillance. Finally, various technical solutions are being developed to improve Bitcoin’s privacy even for casual users, which ensures fungibility going forward. 

While legislation cannot directly influence the Bitcoin protocol, the state may use its power to make things difficult for Bitcoin businesses and users. However, should the state’s influence over certain companies and jurisdictions become sufficiently problematic, users will migrate to competing services and business owners to friendlier locations. It must also be noted that software development is a far quicker and more agile process than bureaucratic decision-making or the formulation of new laws over complex technologies. For now, governments are left playing catch-up.
