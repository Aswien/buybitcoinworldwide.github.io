This article details how to use a previously initialized Ledger HW.1 with [Mycelium](/wallets/mycelium/). Your HW.1 must be setup before use with Mycelium.
{: refdef}

First, make sure you have the latest version of Mycelium installed on your Android device. Open Mycelium and select "new account". If you already have Mycelium installed then skip this step.

![New Mycelium account][1]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

Swipe right to move over to the "Accounts" tab. Click the key on the top right to add a new account. 

![mycelium android accounts][2]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

Click "Advanced". 

![advanced mycelium][3]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

Under "Import a Ledger-HD account" tap "Ledger". 

![import ledger mycelium][4]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

Plug in an OTG cable to your Android device and plug in your HW.1 to the OTG cable. 

![plugin hw1 mycelium][5]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

Enter your HW.1 pin code.

![hw1 pin mycelium][6]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

Mycelium will scan for accounts on your HW.1.

![scan mycelium hw1][7]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

In this case there were no used accounts. If the HW.1 had accounts, you would simply select the account you want to add Mycelium. In this case we wil create a new account by selecting "Import next unused account". 

![hw1 accounts][8]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

Tap "OK". 

![tap okay mycelium][9]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

Name your Ledger HW.1 account on Mycelium. 

![name hw1 mycelium][10]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper .android-img-kb}

You can now send payments from your HW.1 with Mycelium.

Even if the HW.1 is removed after use, the wallet and its addresses will still be viewable in watch-only mode. This way you can still view your balance, generate new addresses, and receive payments.
