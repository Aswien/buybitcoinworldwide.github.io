The Bitcoin mining industry has grown at a rapid pace. Mining, which could once be done on the average home computer, is now only done profitably in specialized data centers. These datacenters are warehouses, filled with computers built for the sole purpose of mining Bitcoin. Today, it costs millions of dollars to even start a profitable mining operation. 

Bitcoin miners are no longer a profitable investment for new Bitcoin users. For example, the AntMiner S7 costs $2,000 on Amazon and would mine about $350 worth of bitcoins per month. This doesn’t include electricity costs. Also, the continuous growth and competition in Bitcoin mining means the $350 per month will become less and less each month. 

Some companies, like 21 Inc., provide a mining chip in their computer that gives you a small but steady stream of bitcoins. However, a 21 Bitcoin computer will not return on its investment and only mines bitcoin to make the process of achieving bitcoins more convenient. 

The days of hobby mining ended a long time ago. Investing in bitcoin mining is not profitable at this time unless you have the necessary capital to start on a large scale and live in a place with cheap electricity. 

If you want a small miner to play around with the network, go for it. But don’t treat your home mining operation as an investment or expect to get any return whatsoever.
