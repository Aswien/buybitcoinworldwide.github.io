Unfortunately, it can be [somewhat difficult to buy bitcoin](/kb/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) instantly. Bitcoin payments are irreversible, while most forms of payment used today are reversible. This means that in order to buy bitcoin fast, you have to use other irreversible forms of payment like cash.

Fortunately, some companies have figured out ways to hedge their risk. Today, it’s even possible to buy bitcoin instantly with a credit card or debit card.  

If you already know which payment method you want to use, jump to a section:

## Buy Bitcoins Instantly with Cash

![localbitcoins][32]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

Peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin exchanges are a great way to get bitcoin instantly. A P2P trade usually works something like this:

1. A buyer and seller use a site like [LocalBitcoins](http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins){:rel="nofollow"} or [BitQuick](http://buybitcoinww.co/buybitquick){:rel="nofollow"} and agree on a price.

2. The seller’s bitcoins are held by the site (in this case [LocalBitcoins](/exchanges/localbitcoins/) or BitQuick) and only released to the buyer upon confirmation of payment.

3. The buyer deposits cash into the seller’s bank account.

4. The seller confirms payment.

5. The site (LocalBitcoins or BitQuick) releases the bitcoins to the buyer.

6. The seller got cash, and the buyer got bitcoins. The trade is complete!  

The above was just an example. Through sites like LocalBitcoins you can agree on other payment methods besides cash deposit. For example, you could arrange to meet in person and exchange cash for Bitcoin.  

There are two main reasons that P2P exchanges offer a near instant way to buy bitcoins:

1. No verification is required. You don’t need to submit any personal details and there is no verification process that takes up time.

![cash](/img/icons/sepa.png){: .img-responsive .halfimg-right }

2. Cash payments are irreversible. Once cash is in someone’s bank account, the buyer of bitcoin has no way to reverse the transaction. So the seller can feel confident that he received payment for bitcoins, and release the bitcoins to the buyer.  

P2P exchanges offer a fast way to buy bitcoins, but P2P exchange rates may be a bit higher than the global average Bitcoin exchange rate. People are willing to pay more to buy bitcoins both more privately and faster. The markup is usually somewhere around 5-10% on [LocalBitcoins](http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins){:rel="nofollow"}. [BitQuick](https://www.bitquick.co/){:target="_blank"} generally has rates close to market. Check the against a Bitcoin price index like Bitcoin Average or the CoinDesk BPI.  

## Bitcoin ATMs (Cash)

Bitcoin ATMs are another great way to purchase bitcoins instantly. While you may have to physically drive or walk to the ATM, once you reach the ATM you can buy bitcoins instantly. You’ll need to be lucky enough to have a Bitcoin ATM in your area. Use [Coin ATM Radar](http://coinatmradar.com/) keeps track of Bitcoin ATMs around the world and makes it easy to locate an ATM in your area. You can do the following to check if there is a Bitcoin ATM near you:

## 1. Go to [CoinATMRadar.com](http://coinatmradar.com/)  

## 2. Search by Location

In the search box in the top left, type in the name of your country or city and click enter.

![coin atm radar][14]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 3. Find an ATM

Once you search, you’ll be taken to the location you entered on the map. If you see map pin markers, you’re in luck! That means there are Bitcoin ATMs in your area.

![coin atm radar][15]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 4. Choose an ATM

Click on one of the map markers for more details about a specific ATM. From there, you can also click on “Read More” at the bottom for even more details.

![coin atm radar][16]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

While Bitcoin ATMs make it easy to buy bitcoin fast, there are some downsides. Bitcoin ATMs generally sell bitcoins at a mark-up of 5-10%. Before you buy bitcoin from an ATM, check the ATM’s price against a Bitcoin price index like Bitcoin Average or the CoinDesk BPI.

Some ATMs may require verification, like a picture of an ID or a finger print scan. These ATMs are a bit slower. Coin ATM Radar provides details on each ATM so be sure to check if the Bitcoin ATM near you requires verification.

## Buy Bitcoin Instantly with PayPal  

PayPal is the most common way to pay online. So, obviously there is an [easy way to buy bitcoin with PayPal](/en/buy-bitcoin-paypal/), right? Unfortunately there isn’t. PayPal actually bans the sale of bitcoins for PayPal merchants. Because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and PayPal transactions are reversible, there would be a very high fraud rate for anyone selling bitcoins for PayPal.  

We’re going to show you the easiest way to convert your PayPal balance to bitcoin: VirWoX. Using VirWoX you’ll end up paying around 9% in fees, but keep in mind this is the cheapest way to convert PayPal to bitcoin. You may need to wait a couple days after opening an account before you can use this method; read more here.  

[VirWoX](http://buybitcoinww.co/bitcoin_virwox){:rel="nofollow"} stands for Virtual World Exchange, and mainly serves as a way for people to buy Second Life Lindens, a currency used in the virtual world Second Life. You can’t buy bitcoin with PayPal directly at VirWoX, but it’s possible to first buy Second Life Lindens (SLL) and then trade your Second Life Lindens for Bitcoin.

## 1. [Open an account](http://buybitcoinww.co/bitcoin_virwox){:rel="nofollow"} on VirWoX

From the home page, click on "Not registered yet?"

![register VirWoX][1]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 2. Enter the details for your account

Now you'll enter your details in order to create an account. Don't get confused by the section titled "Link to avatar". You can leave this untouched.  

![create account virwox][2]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 3. Check your email

At this point, your account has been created. A temporary password will be emailed to the address you provided in step two. 

**This password is temporary and MUST be changed. If you don't change this password within 24 hours your account will be deleted. We show you how to change your password in the next step.**

![check email virwox][3]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 4. Change your password

Once you login with your temporary password, click on "Change settings" in the left sidebar. 

![change password virwox][4]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 5. Create a new password

Enter a new password. 

![create password virwox][5]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 6. Deposit from PayPal

Once you've changed your password, click on "Deposit" in the left sidebar. 

![deposit from paypal][6]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 7. Deposit and select amount

## 8. Login to PayPal

## 9. Verify account balance

If you followed PayPal's directions successfully, you should now see a balance in your VirWoX account. Note that the amount displayed in your VirWoX account may be slightly less than the amount you entered in step 7. This is because PayPal charges a 2.9% + $0.30 fee per deposit. 

After this, click on "USD/SLL". If you deposited with Euro then click "EUR/SLL". 

![check balance][9]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 10. Trade USD for Second Life Lindens

Remember how we said you'll have to buy Second Life Lindens and then trade those for bitcoins? Well, now we're buying the SLL. In this step you need to sell the USD you deposited from PayPal and get SLL. 

Enter the amount of USD you want to sell. 

![trade sll for usd][10]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 11. Complete order

You can see in the top left of the image below that I now have a balance in SLL. If you now have SLL, that means everything has gone well. 

Now click on "BTC/SLL" in the left sidebar. Now we're going to exchange our SLL for bitcoin. 

![exchange][11]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 12. Trade SLL for BTC

The process is the same here. Simply enter the amount of BTC you want to buy and click "Next". 

![paypal to bitcoin][12]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

## 13. Buy bitcoin!

![buy bitcoin][13]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

Once you've purchased your bitcoins, we suggest sending your bitcoins to a wallet you own. In the future, try to buy bitcoin using other [payment methods](/en/payment-methods/) to avoid fees.

Fully verified users with a backup credit card will be able to [buy up to $1,000 worth of bitcoin instantly](http://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-launches-instant-bitcoin-buying-and-selling/) per week. Additionally, users in supported states can [store USD in their account for instant use](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/buy-bitcoins-instantly-using-coinbase-usd-wallets/). 

It may be a pain to wait five days, but at least you give yourself the option to buy bitcoin instantly for future purchases. Here’s how to add a credit card to your account:  

## 1. [Create an Account](http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase){:rel="nofollow"} on Coinbase
