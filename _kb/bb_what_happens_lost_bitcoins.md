Bitcoins are stored in a digital wallet. Each [Bitcoin wallet](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/) contains many addresses, or in some cases, one address. Each address contains a public key and private key. The public key is used to receive payments, and the private key unlocks the funds that the public key contains. 

If a private key is lost, and there is no backup of the wallet, the bitcoins in the wallet are lost forever. 

There’s no way to know for sure which bitcoins have been lost. All address balances are visible, but dormant coins that haven’t been moved in years can’t be proven to be lost.  

Because there are only 21 million bitcoins, lost bitcoins decrease the total supply and make every other bitcoin worth slightly more. Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, described this best [in a forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=198.msg1647#msg1647):

> Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think of it as a donation to everyone.
