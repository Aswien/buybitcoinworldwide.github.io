[Bitcoin private keys](/kb/what-is-a-bitcoin-private-key/) are the secret digital codes which allow bitcoins to be spent. If a private key is lost or destroyed, and there is no backup, bitcoins in the address corresponding to the private key are gone forever. 

There’s no way to know for sure which bitcoins have been lost. All Bitcoin address balances are visible on the blockchain, but dormant coins does not equal lost coins.  

Because there are only 21 million bitcoins, lost bitcoins decrease the total supply and make every other bitcoin worth slightly more. Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, described this best [in a forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=198.msg1647#msg1647):

> Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think of it as a donation to everyone.
