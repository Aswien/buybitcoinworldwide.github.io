Banks today provide many services, such as holding money, securing money, making loans, and making payments. Because Bitcoin eliminates the need for these services, banks hate Bitcoin in the same way horse and buggy companies hated car companies.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, [cited many of the problems with banks](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/p2pfoundation/1/#selection-33.0-33.479){:rel="nofollow"}: 

> Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.

Bitcoin has security, privacy, and proof-of-reserves built in. Let's see how Bitcoin provides all of the services in a better way and stands as a threat to the banks. 

## Holding Money
Banks hold your money in an account in your name. Banks claim that they will honor your balance, but don’t actually have to hold your balance in their reserves. Your account balance is simply a number in their computer. If each and every person belonging to a bank branch decided to withdrawal on the same day, the bank would not be able to provide each person with their cash.  

Bitcoin is more like cash, but easier to secure. If you own bitcoins, you can be sure that you own them by storing them in your own digital [Bitcoin wallet](/wallets/). Most Bitcoin users don’t see a need for banks and enjoy the independence Bitcoin brings to their finances. With Bitcoin you hold your own money. 

## Making Payments
Bitcoin is also a payment system. Unlike bank transfers, which are often limited by amount or by location, Bitcoin payments can be sent in any amount to anywhere in the world. Bitcoin payments confirm in 10 minutes, while bank transfers can take days. 

Credit card payments, for example, require you to provide your name, address and other personal details with each purchase. Bitcoin payments are made directly to Bitcoin addresses and don’t require any personal information to be given. 

In addition to privacy, Bitcoin offers better security and reduces fraud. Credit card payments are “pull” transactions in that the credit card company pulls money from your bank account. Swiping your credit card gives the merchant permission to debit from your account. You must trust that the merchant will only charge the correct amount, and also must trust the merchant will keep your credit card information secure. Bitcoin payments are “push” payments in that you “push” money to the merchant. Bitcoins can only be sent from your wallet if you choose to send them. Making one Bitcoin payments does not allow or approve any future payment. 

## Open to Anyone
Banks have a high barrier to entry, and many people around the world don’t even have a bank account. Bitcoin is open to anyone, while bank accounts are often only available to wealthy people in developed countries.  

Anyone in the world is free to create a Bitcoin wallet. A Bitcoin wallet gives anyone in the world access to a global payment system. If Bitcoin adoption increases, it will create a [global currency](/kb/why-bitcoin-is-good-money/) that will help free trade and remove friction that the current banking system creates. 

## Always Open
Bitcoin is a global network, and not based in any particular country. Unlike banks, it operates 24/7. Banks today are open during hours while most people are at work, and closed when people have free time. Bitcoin payments can be sent anytime, from anywhere, and to anyone. With Bitcoin there is no need to alert anyone of a trip out of the country. Unlike credit cards, there is no way for your Bitcoin wallet to be frozen if you use it in a foreign country. 

## Financial Privacy
Banks know your account balance at all times. They know how much you spend, when you spend, and where you spend. Bitcoin offers financial privacy. No personal information is required when making Bitcoin payments. No one besides the owner of a Bitcoin wallet knows what a payment was made for or from where a payment was made.  

## Final Thoughts
Bitcoin is a currency and payment system built for the digital age. It has the potential to uproot the traditional banking system and clearly offers better solutions for finance. The banks simply see Bitcoin as competition. It is clear that Bitcoin provides many of the services the banks have built their business models upon. They will try to find ways to make the public see Bitcoin as bad. The upcoming years will be interesting as Bitcoin adoption continues to rise.
