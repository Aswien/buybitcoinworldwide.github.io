This site provides all the info necessary for buying Bitcoin, pretty much [anywhere in the world](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/where-to-buy-bitcoins/). While buying bitcoins is the quickest way to get them, it’s not always the most cost-effective. Earning bitcoins instead of buying bitcoins can save a lot of money, if you have the time for it.

Fortunately it’s fairly easy to earn bitcoins online; if you can earn fiat, you can earn bitcoins. All that’s required to earn a decent wage in Bitcoin is a marketable skill or product, combined with the knowledge made available in this guide.

## Automatic Salary Conversion to Bitcoin

If you draw a salary in fiat, nothing prevents you from [purchasing Bitcoin from your local exchange via the most convenient payment method.](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/find-exchange/) However, it can become tiresome to repeat this process every month, week or whenever you’re paid.

Several services exist which automatically convert a portion of your wage or salary to Bitcoin:

[**1. Bitwage**](https://www.bitwage.com/) - this service is available for employees and freelancers in the USA, although expansion to new regions is planned. Bitwage allows the easy conversion of any percentage of payments into Bitcoin. Bitwage offers next-day service and don’t require your employer to register or understand the first thing about Bitcoin. Users only need to add _Bitwage's corporate account as a secondary bank account with their employer._

![bitwage][6]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

[**2. Payroll**](https://bitpay.com/payroll) - the competitor service to Bitwage, offered as a service by the well-known payments company, BitPay. Payroll has very similar features to Bitwage and is also restricted to the USA at present.

[**3. Get Paid in Bitcoin**](http://www.getpaidinbitcoin.com.au/) - a variation on the above services for workers in Australia.

## Find Bitcoin-Paying Work on Job Boards

Coding skills are in high demand in this sector, particularly for those who’ve mastered Bitcoin. Other skills which translate well to the internet (such as website creation, graphic design, writing, journalism, translation, video production, etc.) are also highly sought-after. Just about any useful service can earn Bitcoin however, so don’t be discouraged if your talents lie elsewhere.

Once you land a job, it’s advised to request an escrowed payment from any new employer. This is especially important for tasks demanding a considerable time commitment.

If you’re looking for jobs which pay in bitcoins, these sites offer some of the best listings:

[**4. Reddit’s Jobs4Bitcoins**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4bitcoins) - this informal job board allows you to advertise your services and view a modest range of job offers. Most of the work is presented on a freelance or temporary basis. Jobs4Bitcoins is great for finding a quick gig but not the ideal choice for someone seeking a more permanent position.

![/r/jobs4bitcoins][3]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

[**5. BitcoinTalk Forum’s Services section**](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0) - this forum allows you to view many, diverse job offers and advertise your services, in detail and with images if you so desire. Jobs range widely, from the expected coding bounties to bizarre tasks like retyping World War 2 documents and mundane work like captcha completion.

Within the Services section, many signature advertising campaigns are advertised. Such methods for earning bitcoins are addressed later as a separate topic.

[**6. XBT Freelancer**](https://www.xbtfreelancer.com/index.php) - this more traditionally-styled job board presents a diverse range of opportunities. Many tasks are unrelated to Bitcoin and typical of the jobs offered on fiat-based freelancer sites, like elance.

[**7. Coinality**](https://coinality.com/) -another great job board, with more of a technology focus. Features many Bitcoin-related, permanent positions as well as numerous coding bounties.
