In answering "Why use Bitcoin?", we will give more judgemental answers, like worldwide payments, financial privacy, sound monetary policy. 

## What is Bitcoin Used For? 

### Investment 
People view Bitcoin as "digital gold". Many believe its scarcity and utility will make it worth many times its current value in the future. Bitcoin’s supply can’t be inflated, as its 21 million cap is built into the code. This means that governments and other third parties can’t alter the supply.

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million. Combine scarcity with utility--bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world—and you can see why some investors are extremely bullish.

Some consider it to be the “[greatest form of money we’ve ever seen](http://bigthink.com/think-tank/why-bitcoin-is-the-best-form-of-money-weve-ever-seen-with-wences-casares)”.

Bitcoin has properties that could make it worth many times more than its current price of ~$270, but it doesn’t come without risks. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and could crash due to some unforeseen reason or loss of confidence. There could also be an unknown bug in the protocol that makes Bitcoin unusable, not secure, or vulnerable to attack.

## Why Use Bitcoin?

### Trading
Bitcoin has been extremely volatile for most of its history. Traders buy and sell bitcoin frequently in order to try and cash out on Bitcoin’s price action.
