Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, managed to mine a large amount of bitcoins during Bitcoin’s first year of existence. In Bitcoin’s early days, only a few people used the network so Satoshi had little competition while mining. [It’s estimated](https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/) that Satoshi holds a fortune of about 1 million bitcoins.

Note that Satoshi’s true identity is still unknown. Satoshi may have been a man, woman, or a group of people working under one pseudonym. It’s also possible that the person or people who worked under name Satoshi are no longer alive. 

## Does Satoshi Still Have his Wallet? 

The first question people ask about Satoshi’s holdings is whether or not he still [has the private key](/kb/what-is-a-bitcoin-private-key/) to access his coins. Satoshi never discussed his holdings, but, in reply to another user who deleted his wallet, Satoshi said: 

> “Sigh... why delete a wallet instead of moving it aside and keeping the old copy just in case?  You should never delete a wallet.”

Based on this, many feel certain that Satoshi still controls the entirety of his bitcoin holdings. 

## Would Satoshi spend his fortune? 

Many wonder if Satoshi would ever sell, spend, or move his coins. This question is harder to answer. Satoshi is an anonymous person or group of people. Spending some of the 1 million coins would bring a lot of attention towards Satoshi and [potentially jeopardize his identity and the anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#Uncertainty) that he clearly valued.
