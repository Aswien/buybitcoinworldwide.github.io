We’re going to show you a ton of easy ways to get bitcoins. We’re certain there is something on this list that will have you on your way to getting bitcoins! Let’s get started.

## 1. Buy Bitcoin

The [quick answer](https://blockchain.info/wallet/how-to-get-bitcoins) to “how to get bitcoins” and the easiest way is to simply buy bitcoins. Remember, bitcoin is money. It’s valuable. There is no easy way to get bitcoins for free. You’re going to have to buy bitcoins or work for them.  

In order to buy bitcoins, you’ll need to exchange your local currency, like the dollar or euro, for bitcoin. We [offer a tool to help you find a bitcoin exchange in your country](/where-to-buy-bitcoins/). Here’s an overview of the most common payment methods:

**Credit Card**

[Circle](https://circle.com/) is the easiest way for U.S. residents to [get bitcoin with a credit card or debit card](/en/buy-bitcoin-credit-debit-card/). Europeans can buy bitcoin with a 3D secure credit or debit card at [Coinbase](http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase){:rel="nofollow"}. Coinmama lets anyone in the world buy bitcoin with a credit card.

**Bank Transfer**

Bank transfer is one of the best and easiest ways to buy bitcoins in most countries. Bank transfers often let users get bitcoin in larger amounts. Use our tool to find an exchange in your country that accepts bank transfer.

**Cash**

Cash payment is one of the fastest ways to get bitcoins. Cash deposits are verified very quickly, and services like BitQuick often deliver your bitcoins within a couple hours. Use [LocalBitcoins](http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins){:rel="nofollow"} to get bitcoins via cash deposit or in-person cash trade, or [BitQuick](http://buybitcoinww.co/buybitquick){:rel="nofollow"} to buy bitcoin with cash deposit.

**Bitcoin ATMs**

Bitcoin ATMs are a decent way to buy bitcoin if you are lucky enough to have one in your area. Use [Coin ATM Radar](http://coinatmradar.com/) to locate an ATM near you.

**PayPal**

There is [no way to directly get bitcoins with PayPal](/en/buy-bitcoin-paypal/). Under PayPal’s terms and conditions merchants are not allowed to sell bitcoins for PayPal. However, there are a few hacks to get around this. You can buy other digital items with PayPal and sell those items for bitcoin. For example, at VirWoX you can buy Second Life Lindens, another digital currency, and exchange the Lindens for bitcoin.

## Get Paid in Bitcoin or Work for Bitcoin 

Working for bitcoins is one of the easiest ways to get bitcoins.

**2. Get Paid in Bitcoin**

[BitWage](https://www.bitwage.com/) is a service that lets workers receive their wages in bitcoin even if an employer doesn’t pay in bitcoin. Here’s how it works.  

1. A worker creates an account on BitWage

2. The worker then receives a unique bank account number that he or she can give to the employer

3. The employer uses a regular bank transfer to pay the worker’s wages, and sends the worker’s salary to the unique bank account number provided by BitWage

4. BitWage receives the fiat currency and converts it to bitcoin

5. BitWage sends the bitcoin to the worker  

![bitwage][6]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper} 

BitWage charges a 1% fee on conversions. However, if you we’re going to buy bitcoin anyway the automation and convenience may be worth the fee.

**3. Jobs4Bitcoins**

[Jobs 4 Bitcoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4bitcoins) is a sub-reddit that connects people who want to work for bitcoin or need work done and want to pay in bitcoin.

Create a reddit account, login, and offer up your services. Here is an example job post made by someone offering up translation services:  

**4. Bitcointalk.org**

Another way to find jobs that pay in bitcoin is the [bitcointalk.org marketplace](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0). There are hundreds of posts per day with job offers that pay in bitcoin.  

Don’t worry if you have no special skills to offer. There are simple jobs posted often. For example, [I wanted feedback](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1266721.0) on Buy Bitcoin Worldwide. I offered $1 to anyone who provided quality feedback. I ended up paying out $5 to the people who offered constructive feedback.

![get bitcoins][1]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper} 

Stay alert and be on the lookout for simple jobs.

If you can’t find any jobs that pay in bitcoin, you can always work a regular job. Earn regular currency like the dollar and simply buy bitcoins with your earnings. It’s less exciting, but still a simple way to get bitcoins.

## Earn Bitcoin Tips

**5. Zapchain**

[Zapchain](https://www.zapchain.com/) is a collection of online communities focused on specific topics. With Bitcoin tipping built in, it’s easy to participate and earn tiny amounts of Bitcoin.

Using a Bitcoin payment processor like [BitPay](https://bitpay.com/) or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/merchants), you can easily accept Bitcoin in your online or brick and mortar store. While both Coinbase and BitPay are built for merchants who want to cash out bitcoin to fiat, it’s possible to accept all or a percentage of your bitcoin payments as bitcoin.

Large online merchants like [NewEgg, Overstock, and Microsoft accept Bitcoin payments online](http://www.coindesk.com/information/what-can-you-buy-with-bitcoins/).

**8. OpenBazaar**

One of the most exciting projects in the Bitcoin-world is [OpenBazaar](http://openbazaar.org/). OpenBazaar is a decentralized market place, meaning no central authority controls the listings. The benefits of decentralized markets are significant: lower fees, the ability to sell anything with no rules, and less friction when trading. Think eBay without the 10% fees.

![streamium get bitcoins][5]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper} 

**10. Joystream**

[Joystream](http://joystream.co/) lets you earn money for sharing your bandwidth as a torrent seeder. Imagine there’s a free e-book and you want to earn money for seeding. You set your price and anyone who wants to download the file will need to pay you for using your bandwidth.  

**11. Satoshi Box**

[Satoshi Box](http://satoshibox.com/) makes it easy to sell digital files for bitcoin. Let’s say you created a PDF recipe book. You’d like to sell it for 1 BTC per download.

**12. WatchMyBit**

[WatchMyBit](http://www.watchmybit.com/) is like YouTube but with one catch: anyone who wants to view your video must pay bitcoin before being able to view. You can use WatchMyBit to monetize videos without ads.

## Play Games

**13. Chopcoin**  
[Chopcoin](http://buybitcoinww.co/chopcoin_io) is a skill game where you begin as a tiny bubble and try to grow big. You compete against other players in a 10 minute match. At the end of 10 minutes, the player who is the largest bubble wins and earns bitcoin.

## 15. Bitcoin Faucets

Bitcoin faucets pay tiny amounts of bitcoin at specified time intervals. Here’s a [simple explanation from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_faucet):  

“Bitcoin faucet is a website that gives out "free" bitcoins (BTC) in exchange for doing a simple task, such as clicking on an advert, solving a CAPTCHA, or viewing a webpage for a certain amount of time.”  

Some of the most popular Bitcoin faucets are: [Bitcoin Zebra](http://buybitcoinww.co/btc_zebra), [Milli.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/milli_io), [Break The Coin](http://buybitcoinww.co/break_the_coin), [BibiFaucet](http://buybitcoinww.co/bibi_faucet), and [Robot Coin Game](http://buybitcoinww.co/robot_coin_game).  

Bitcoin faucets are a win-win for both users and the faucet operator: users get free bitcoins, and faucet operators make money from ads displayed on the page.

You’ll only get a small amount of bitcoins with faucets and you’ll need patience. Still, faucets are a great way to get started with Bitcoin. A small faucet payout can go along way if it helps you make your first Bitcoin transaction.  

If you have a lot of time on your hands and are serious about faucets, use a [faucet rotator](http://rotator.99bitcoins.com/) to maximize your time.

## 16. Create your own Bitcoin Faucet  

Using [this great guide](https://99bitcoins.com/step-by-step-guide-two-methods-to-building-a-bitcoin-faucet/) from 99Bitcoins you can learn how to make your very own Bitcoin faucet. If you can spread the word about your faucet and really get people to use it, you’ll be able to create a steady stream of bitcoin.

## Bitcoin Ads

**17. CoinURL**

CoinURL is an anonymous advertising network. CoinURL partners are paid per-click with bitcoin.  

You can also use CoinURL to create short links and earn tiny amounts of bitcoin for each user that enters each link.

![coinurl][9]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper} 

**18. CoinAd**  

CoinAd is another Bitcoin advertising network that claims to serve up 350 million page views per month.

## 19. Bitcoin Affiliate Programs  

Another easy way to get bitcoins is to refer your friends to other Bitcoin companies or websites. Affiliate programs pay you for bringing customers to a specific company.

[Coinbase](http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase){:rel="nofollow"} is the most advertised affiliate program in the Bitcoin-world. Coinbase pays both the referrer and the referred user $10 if the referred user buys at least $100 worth of bitcoin.  

Bitcoin faucets also often pay out bitcoins through referral programs. For example, [Milli.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/milli_io) pays 65% of the faucet earnings for each user that an affiliate refers. So if you refer a user who earns 100,000 satoshi through Milli.io’s faucet, you’ll earn 65,000 satoshi.  

The best part about most Bitcoin affiliate programs is that they pay in bitcoin!
