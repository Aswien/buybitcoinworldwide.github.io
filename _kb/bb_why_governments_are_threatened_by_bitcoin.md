Governments currently have a monopoly on money creation. Policy makers are free to issue new money if they decide to do so. Issuing money is a powerful tool and can be used as a weapon. Governments would lose a lot of power if their populations shifted away from national fiat currencies.

## Inflation
When a stock split happens, the newly issued shares don’t suddenly make the company worth more than it was. The newly issued shares simply take value from the already issued shares, and the market cap of the company will stay more or less the same. The same is true with currency. When new currency is issued, each newly issued unit of currency must take a small amount of value from each existing unit of currency. This is inflation, essentially a hidden tax on the entire population.

Venezuela’s currency crisis stems from the over-issuance of currency and bad economic policy which caused inflation. The Venezuelan government printed so much new money that the currency held by the population has  rapidly lost its purchasing power. Venezuela’s national currency, the Bolivar, has become so worthless that it’s cheaper to use the [paper currency as napkins instead of actual napkins](http://uk.businessinsider.com/venezuelas-currency-is-now-so-worthless-that-people-are-using-it-as-napkins-2015-8). The value lost by Venezuelan citizens didn’t disappear, but was transferred over to the government in the form of newly printed money. 

Bitcoin is outside of government control, and [no government has the ability to alter Bitcoin’s monetary policy](/kb/why-bitcoin-is-resistant-government-takeover/). Bitcoin removes governments’ ability to transfer wealth via inflation. 

## Bitcoin Gets Around Capital Controls
In 2013, [Cyprus had a financial meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Cypriot_financial_crisis). Capital controls were implemented and citizens were banned from moving large amounts of money out of the country. Around the same time, Bitcoin’s price started to increase at a rapid pace and set new all-time highs. No, mass amounts of Cypriots didn’t start throwing their life savings into Bitcoin. But this crisis brought Bitcoin into the spotlight and people realized Bitcoin’s potential as a way around capital controls. 

Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world without permission. Any amount of bitcoin can be sent with no restrictions. Besides shutting down the internet, a government has no way to block or restrict Bitcoin payments either in or out of a country. In financial havoc like in Cyprus, Bitcoin provides a service that cannot be found in any other money or payment system. 

## Your Money is your Money
[Greece’s debt crisis](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/business/international/greece-debt-crisis-euro.html?_r=0) helped highlight the importance of having control of money. In an attempt to retain capital, the Greek banks placed limits on the amount of funds citizens were able to withdrawal at the bank or via ATM. For example, only 60 euros could be withdrawn via cash per day, with a maximum of 420 per week. Greeks were fooled into thinking the money in the bank was really theirs.

With Bitcoin, you, and only you, have [control over your money](/kb/how-to-store-and-protect-bitcoins/). Bitcoin is more like cash. If you hold cash, only physical force can take it away from you. Your Bitcoin, if stored properly, cannot be held by a bank or other third party. Bitcoin provides more financial freedom and reduces the risks that third parties like banks or government limits can introduce. What happened in Greece can happen anywhere. Bitcoin can be used to completely eliminate the risk of having your money held by government laws or banks. 

## The War on Cash
[Capital controls and withdrawal limits](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/06/economist-explains-21) are all part of something bigger, which is the war on cash. Cash is hard to track and harder to control. Governments want to monitor payments, and know the intent behind each purchase. Bitcoin provides similar privacy to cash and makes it harder for governments to understand the destination of payments or the purpose behind them. 

Bitcoin doesn’t need to be stored with a bank and your funds don’t need to be tied to an account in your name. 

## Final Thoughts
Monetary policy in the hands of government has proven to be dangerous and detrimental to entire populations. It works well for slowly leeching wealth from an entire nation of citizens, but has proven catastrophic to both entire economies and to individuals. Bitcoin offers sound monetary policy and an escape from the destruction that fiat currencies have caused.
