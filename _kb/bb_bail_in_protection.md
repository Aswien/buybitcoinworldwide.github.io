The old expression “money in the bank,” signifying some reliable outcome, requires a modern update. 

[When they were bailed out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program) at taxpayer expense and when [billions of Euros were seized](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/10024209/Bank-of-Cyprus-executes-depositor-bail-in.html) from Cypriot savers, banks lost their reputation for reliability. Nowadays, the more apt expression would be “money in the blockchain.” In Bitcoin, your savings can’t be seized (if you [keep your private key](/kb/what-is-a-bitcoin-private-key/) a secret) and your [wallet software](/wallets/) won’t bankrupt itself betting on property bubbles. Read on for an in-depth risk comparison between bank accounts and Bitcoin wallets.

## Bail-outs and Bail-ins

The meaning of “bail-out” is generally understood: money is injected into an insolvent company so that it can service its debts. The aim is to keep the company operational long enough to restructure and return to profitability. The term “bail-in” often requires more explanation. 

If a bank becomes insolvent, the standard practice is for its debts to be restructured. Those who lent the bank money on the safest terms, known as the senior creditors, usually get all their money back. More junior creditors lose a percentage of their loan value, which is put towards paying the bank’s loan. This process is repeated down the ranks of creditors, with those at the bottom likely to lose the full value of their loan or shareholding.

## The Cyprus Bail-in

The advantage of a bail-in over a bail-out is that no tax money is required to “fix” the insolvent bank. Bail-outs are politically radioactive; the public rightly perceives them as a means for banks to enjoy [private profits but socialised losses](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatizing-profits-and-socializing-losses.asp), leading inevitably to [moral hazard](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/moral-hazard.asp). 

What was so obscene about the way the bail-in process was handled in Cyprus, however, was that regular depositors were treated as junior creditors. In other words, bank debts were repaid first and foremost from the accounts of regular citizens. The senior creditors, governments and (central) banks, got their money back. This was a terrible injustice, given said entities can borrow or create [money for nothing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCThv5tYUVaG4ZPA3p6EXZbQ). (An even more catastrophic “bail-in” occurred in [Argentina](http://landingpadba.com/2001-argentine-economic-crisis/) in 2001.)

## Coming Global Bail-ins

Bank deposits were formally regarded as [inviolable](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inviolable) but this no longer holds. The Cyprus bail-in was declared the [“template”](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/uk-eurogroup-cyprus-dijsselbloem-idUKBRE92O0IL20130325) for future European bank crises. This policy became the global norm in late 2014, when the G-20 (leading economies) [agreed](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/12/mark-nestmann/worldwide-bail-ins-are-coming/) to implement laws allowing major banks to back their derivative gambling with depositor funds. 

If your bank bets on oil to rise but it falls instead, your funds will cover their loss. Given [the derivatives market is estimated](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/05/top-derivatives-expert-finally-gives-a-credible-estimate-of-the-size-of-the-global-derivatives-market.html) at 20 times larger than the entire world economy, depositors might reasonably expect to be stripped down to the bone... Megabanks are [Too Big To Fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail) but citizens a different matter entirely.

## Solutions

While they await the next inevitable crisis of what can no longer be termed “capitalism,” intelligent people are taking steps to preserve their wealth. Property, precious metals, fine art, productive assets and shares are all worthy of investigation but beyond the scope of this article. A balanced portfolio of assets should be the goal; it’s too risky to rely solely upon cryptocurrency for wealth preservation. Before investigating [Bitcoin’s role](/kb/what-is-bitcoin/) however, one question needs answering:

## “Why not Cash?”

The obvious reason is that inflationary cash is a [poor long-term store of value](/kb/hedge-against-inflation-with-bitcoin/) - just compare current supermarket prices with last year’s. 

Another reason to avoid cash is the top-down effort underway to eliminate cash as a payment mechanism, termed [“the war on cash.”](https://mises.org/library/war-cash-why-now) Physical money, although flawed, still allows people a degree of financial independence, which is becoming unacceptable to the ruling class. Cash payment limitation laws are likely to tighten and spread in future. They currently exist in Russia, Mexico and Uruguay, as well as most of Europe. 

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin, properly managed, is not subject to any of the above risks. [Your wallet](/wallets/) serves as a virtual vault to which [your private key is the only access code](/kb/what-is-a-bitcoin-private-key/). Short of torturing you for your password and key, there’s no way for a third party to seize your funds. [Bitcoin holders](/kb/investing-in-bitcoin/) are therefore not exposed to the risk of policy changes by banks or governments. Around the time of the Cyprus bail-in, Bitcoin prices surged as the market [recognized](http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/28/investing/bitcoin-cyprus/index.html) its value as a safe haven. This implies that Bitcoin holders, far from being threatened by any future bail-in, are likely to profit from it instead.
