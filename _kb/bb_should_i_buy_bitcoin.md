Most people ask the same question when first hearing about Bitcoin: “should I buy bitcoin?”

You shouldn’t buy bitcoin without completely understanding the risks or how it works. Bitcoin is new and complex and it can take months to understand just the basics.

People buy bitcoin for a number of reasons. If you see the value in a specific use case, then you may have a reason to buy some bitcoin.

*Before buying bitcoin you’ll have to understand how to create a wallet and send transactions. Without a basic understanding of how to send bitcoin you are at risk of losing your money due to fraud, scams, or losing the private keys to your wallet. Use [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) to find the right wallet.* 

## Bitcoin as an Investment 

If you want to buy [bitcoin as an investment](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/kb/investing-in-bitcoin/) you need to understand the economics of Bitcoin and the risks involved. 

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million. Combine scarcity with utility--bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world—and you can see why some investors are extremely bullish. Because of this combination many people call bitcoin “digital gold”. Some consider it to be the “[greatest form of money we’ve ever seen](http://bigthink.com/think-tank/why-bitcoin-is-the-best-form-of-money-weve-ever-seen-with-wences-casares){:rel="nofollow"}”. 

Bitcoin can also be stored with no bank or third party. Bitcoin can’t be confiscated, your account can’t be frozen, and there are no limits on how much money you can send or receive. Bitcoin’s supply is capped and can’t be [inflated by government](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/kb/hedge-against-inflation-with-bitcoin). These properties make Bitcoin less restrictive than any other payment system or currency, and storing your wealth in money with these properties adds enormous value for some people. 

Bitcoin has properties that could make it worth many times more than its current price of ~$270, but it doesn’t come without risks. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and could crash due to some unforeseen reason or loss of confidence. There could also be an unknown bug in the protocol that makes Bitcoin unusable, not secure, or vulnerable to attack. Some people believe that bitcoin is antifragile, meaning each day Bitcoin is not destroyed it becomes stronger and less likely to go away. 

If you see value in Bitcoin’s properties, buying some as an investment can give you exposure to a brand new asset class. 

## Online Spending

Merchants that accept Bitcoin and convert to fiat usually only pay 1% in fees, compared to 3% with credit cards. In some cases merchants pass on the difference in fees on to customers as a discount. 

At [Purse.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/purse_io){:rel="nofollow"} you can get a discount of up to 25%. At Gyft you get 3% back in Gyft points, compared to 2% with PayPal and only 1% with credit or debit card. Many other small merchants offer discounts, and it’s not hard to find discounts of up to 10%. 

## Remittances

Bitcoin payments are borderless and currently cost about $0.03. Any internet connected device anywhere in the world can receive bitcoin. 

Companies are starting to take advantage of Bitcoin’s global nature. Remittance services like coins.ph use Bitcoin to help people send money back home. A Filipino worker in Europe can buy bitcoin, send it to coins.ph, and have cash available to his family within a day for less than a 1% fee. Compare this to remittance companies like Western Union that charge on average 10% and Bitcoin comes out the clear winner. 

If you make remittances frequently, use [rebittance.org](https://rebittance.org/) to see if there is a cash out option in your destination country.
 
No one can tell you for sure whether or not to [buy bitcoin](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/), and you shouldn’t [invest](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/kb/investing-in-bitcoin/) more than you can lose. But bitcoin offers a good chance to invest in a new technology and asset class, and also has high utility in online shopping and remittances.
