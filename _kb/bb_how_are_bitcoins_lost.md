Bitcoins are stored in [Bitcoin wallets](/wallets/), which contain private keys. A private key is similar to a password in that it gives you the ability to spend from a certain Bitcoin address. A private key is like the key to a vault. Without the private key to a corresponding Bitcoin address, it’s impossible to spend from that address. If private keys are destroyed, and no backup is available, these specific bitcoins are gone forever.

{:refdef: .note}
Bitcoin addresses are generated randomly. The total amount of possible Bitcoin addresses is so high, that it’s impossible to randomly generate the same address.

## Losing Private keys

**Example 1:** A paper wallet is a private key and bitcoin address that are printed. If one copy of a paper wallet is printed and then destroyed there is no way for the private key to be recovered. The Bitcoins that were stored in that paper wallet are gone for ever. 

**Example 2:** Most mobile wallets generate a 12 or 24 word seed upon creation of the wallet. The seed is used to generate all of your addresses. Instead of backing up each new address and its private key, you simply backup your wallet seed that can recreate the entire wallet and its private keys. If you don’t backup the seed, and remove the app from your phone, any bitcoins stored in this wallet will be gone forever. 

## Proof of burn

Bitcoins can only be spent if the user has the private key to a Bitcoin address. However, it’s possible to send bitcoins to addresses where the private key is unknown. Bitcoins sent to these addresses are gone forever and can’t be recovered. 

There’s no way to know for sure which [bitcoins have been lost](/kb/what-happens-when-bitcoins-are-lost/). All address balances are visible, but dormant coins that haven’t been moved in years can’t be proven to be lost. The only bitcoins that can be claimed to be lost for sure are burned bitcoins. Someone could claim to lose their private key, but there’s no way to verify for sure that there is no additional backup. The same goes for hacks or scams. If someone hacks a bitcoin exchange and the exchange loses bitcoins, those bitcoins aren’t really lost. The stolen bitcoins are still in circulation. The company itself lost bitcoins, but these bitcoins stay in circulation.
