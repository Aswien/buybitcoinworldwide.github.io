Paper money, and coins, are easy to fake. Someone who finds a good way to print counterfeit bills can do so on a mass scale, and isnâ€™t always discovered right away. It can also be hard to verify precious metals and doing so often comes at a high cost. 

There are no counterfeit bitcoins because Bitcoin uses cryptography to verify transactions. Math, not people, verifies Bitcoin transactions. 

Cryptography prevents people from sending fake bitcoins or transactions because only the correct digital signature will allow bitcoins to be spent. This prevents people from spending bitcoins they do not own or creating bitcoins that were not issued by the network. 

Miners secure the network and are given bitcoins as a reward. This is the only way new bitcoins are issued. Bitcoins rewarded to miners are the only bitcoins that can be spent. It is impossible for a single user to bring new bitcoins into supply.
