Bitcoin can be hard to understand, and, therefore, difficult to use. It takes a bit of effort to spend or secure bitcoins. We want to help you avoid rookie mistakes that we’ve seen countless times. If you follow the principles laid out in this list, you’ll prevent yourself from silly errors that will cost you both money and time. 

## Bitcoin Payments are Irreversible
Bitcoin payments are irreversible. If you send bitcoins to the wrong address, there is a very small chance you’ll get them back. 

If you don’t understand how to send and receive bitcoins, learn more before trying with larger amounts. Buy a small amount; like $5 worth. Send a few small payments back and forth between wallets to get a feel for how Bitcoin payments work. Don’t deal with larger amounts of bitcoin until you’re comfortable. 

## Leaving Bitcoins on an Exchange
> Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. - George Santayana

Take these words of wisdom and learn about the history of Bitcoin scams. Bitcoin exchanges play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s economy. People need an easy way to exchange their fiat currency for bitcoins. But, do not use Bitcoin exchanges as a wallet or store coins on an exchange for an extended period of time. 

There are countless cases of people leaving bitcoins on an exchange, only to have the exchange shut down and run away with all of the bitcoins. The most famous example of this is Mt. Gox. Over 650,000 bitcoins were lost when Mt. Gox shut down. 

Never store bitcoins on an exchange or with a third party. 

## Storing Large amounts of Bitcoin in a Hot Wallet
Bitcoins are valuable, and scammers frequently target Bitcoin users. If you have a significant amount of bitcoins, make sure that your coins are secured properly. Use hardware wallets and cold storage to be certain that hackers cannot take your coins.

Hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano and TREZOR are simple solutions that will protect your bitcoins. Paper wallets are another option.  

## Don’t Ever Delete a Bitcoin Wallet
> Sigh… why delete a wallet instead of moving it aside and keeping the old copy just in case? You should never delete a wallet. – Satoshi Nakamoto

Satsohi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, told people to never delete a wallet. Bitcoin addresses can only be generated one time. If you create a wallet and lose the wallets private keys, any bitcoins stored in that wallet are gone forever. 

Listen to Satoshi. Don’t end up like James Howells, the British man who trashed a hard drive that contained his Bitcoin wallet with over 7,500 bitcoins (about $2.5 million dollars at the time of this post).  Unfortunately, James’ bitcoins are gone forever as the hard drive is likely destroyed or ruined even it were to be found. Learn from James and don’t delete a wallet no matter how much money you’re dealing with. You never know.
