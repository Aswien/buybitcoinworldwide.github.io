Tuur Demeester is a Bitcoin investor, economist, and the Editor in Chief at [Adamant Research](http://adamantresearch.com). He started recommending Bitcoin as an investment when each bitcoin was $5. 

In a [recent AMA at Bitcoin.com](https://forum.bitcoin.com/ama-ask-me-anything/i-m-tuur-demeester-bitcoin-investor-economist-and-founder-of-adamant-research-ask-me-anything-t2911.html), Demeester shared his thoughts on Bitcoin's price, Bitcoin's next bubble, and more. 

## Bitcoin Price in 2016

Demeester believes 2016 could be the year Bitcoin returns to its 2013 price levels, when it reached $1,000 per bitcoin. 

> I think that in 2016 we are going to see a rally in Bitcoin during which the $1,000 level may be challenged (I give this a 60% chance*) or exceeded (I give that a 40% chance).

Demeester stated that traditional market volatility and increased interest in Bitcoin as a speculative asset could create demand for bitcoins. Demeester went on to say that Bitcoin's block halving could be another reason for a price increase.  

> The block reward halving of summer 2016, which will cut the Bitcoin money supply down from about 10% to about 50% per annum.

## What is Bitcoin? 

The bigger issue in the block size debate is how a change in the block size could affect Bitcoin's most important attributes. Some see Bitcoin as a payment network, while some see Bitcoin as a store of value due to its sound monetary properties. Demeester sees Bitcoin as a store of value, and less as a payment network.

> The Bitcoin blockchain will never be and does not need to be a Visa-like network. I see the purpose of the main chain as a value anchor rather than a payment network. I see it as evolving towards a network of big gold vaults rather than a ledger everyone uses for paying a beer and tipping. The latter type transactions will happen on sidechains or via off-chain transactions (exchanges & online wallets), possibly facilitated by lightning network technology. 

## The Next Bitcoin Bubble

Throughout its history, [Bitcoin has experienced many hype cycles](/kb/what-determines-bitcoins-price/). A rapid price increase has always been followed by a slow, steady downtrend. When asked to predict the peak of the next Bitcoin bubble, Demeester estimated a broad range from $1,000 up to $3,000:

> As for the top of the next bubble, if it comes, I honestly have no idea. On the high end I find myself talking about $3,000, on the low end $1,000. Determining the top of the bubble is better done using ways to gauge sentiment, in my experience. The level of exuberance in the media and on forums will often tell you more than a price chart.

Since Demeester's AMA on November 22, 2015, Bitcoin's price is up about 30%.
