It’s no secret: at Buy Bitcoin Worldwide, we’re holders. We value our bitcoins, and don’t go looking to spend them. However, if a merchant offers a large discount for paying with bitcoins then it may be worth it to spend bitcoins instead of fiat currency. 

We want to show you an example of when one might want to spend bitcoins instead of holding them. The iPhone is a commonly used, somewhat expensive device. We’ll show how to buy an iPhone with bitcoin as an example of the discounts out there for Bitcoin users. 

An iPhone, purchased without a contract, costs hundreds of dollars. By spending bitcoins you can easily save over $100 dollars, or more, if you're not in a rush and are patient. 

## Purse.io
[Purse.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/purse_io) is an escrow service. They match buyers, who want to buy bitcoins, with spenders who are looking to spend bitcoins. Spenders first create an Amazon wish list containing the items they wish to order. The spender then adds the list to [Purse.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/purse_io) along with a requested discount. For example if you want to buy $100 worth of items at a 15% discount, you’d offer $85 worth of bitcoins to the buyer who orders your wish list for you. 

The discount comes from buyers who exchange their Amazon credit for bitcoins. Gift card credits are hard to exchange. Buying items on Amazon for someone else is an easy way to get bitcoins in return for the gift card credit that buyers don’t want.  

Buyers can browse all of the wish lists on [Purse.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/purse_io). Buyers then order the items for spenders. Upon delivery the buyer will receive the agreed upon amount of bitcoins, and the spender receives the items that were on his wish list. It may take a few days  for someone to order your items, especially for a more expensive item like the iPhone. I’ve had luck getting 35% discounts but had to wait almost ten days. A 20% discount should get your items ordered within two days and delivered within a week. 

At the time of this post, an iPhone 6S 16 GB [costs $715](http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Warranty-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B015E8TKS0/ref=sr_1_2?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1446221985&sr=1-2&keywords=iphone+6s) on Amazon. A 20% discount would save you $143 and bring the total price down to $572. Imagine using [Purse.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/purse_io) for all of your spending. 

If you're in a rush, [Purse.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/purse_io) offers an instant service: Purse Instant. You save 5% and your item is delivered with Amazon prime meaning it gets delivered in 2 days. A 5% discount on a $715 iPhone is still $35.75 of savings. 

## Gyft
If you want to buy an iPhone in person, or prefer to buy from somewhere other than Amazon, [Gyft](https://www.gyft.com/) is a good option. Gyft is a digital gift card reseller that gives you 3% back on each purchase made with Bitcoin. The 3% is given to you in the form of Gyft Points. Your Gyft points can be saved and put towards future purchases like an iPhone. To buy the iPhone with Gyft you can buy a gift card for use at eBay, Target, Amazon, or Best Buy. 

It’s clear that Bitcoin offers some amazing opportunities for discounts and arbitrage. Be sure to take advantage of it whenever possible. Remember, your bitcoins are valuable and better than fiat money. Merchants should have to offer you a discount in order to get you to spend your bitcoins.
