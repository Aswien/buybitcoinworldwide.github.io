Circle is a Bitcoin broker and [Bitcoin wallet](/wallets/) platform. This page reviews Circles Bitcoin brokerage services (go here to see a [review of Circle's Bitcoin wallet](/wallets/circle/)).

## Payment Methods Accepted
Circle accepts three payment methods: bank account (ACH transfer), credit card, or debit card. 

## Privacy
Circle requires identity verification and personal details. 

## Limits & Liquidity
Users are initially given a limit of $300 of combined buying/selling/sending per week. After some time, you may be able to have this limit increased to $3,000. 

For example, if you buy $50 worth of bitcoin and then send $25 worth of bitcoin to a friend, you will have used $75 out of the $300 limit. 

## Speed
To have your bitcoin available instantly you must buy with a debit card. Buys made with credit card or bank account take 3-5 days for the bitcoin to become available.  

## Reputation
Circle is a VC backed company and fully regulated. It carries the proper licenses in all of the districts in which it operates.   

## Fees
Circle doesn't charge a fee, but generally has a sell price around 0.5% more than global exchanges like Bitstamp. Among Bitcoin brokers, Circle often has the best rate. 

## Supported Countries
Circle is available to U.S. residents. 

## Customer Support
Circle offers customer support via [email](https://support.circle.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). 

## Past Issues
