## Privacy
CEX.io requires very little information for its first tier of verification. In order to increase your limits, however, a number of personal details and document scans are required. 

To increase your daily limits to CEX.io's "Verified" verification level, you'll be required to submit scans of a passport, driver's license, or ID. In addition, you'll need to submit a picture of you holding your ID, a picture holding your credit card, and a document for proof of residency. 

## Speed
After initial verification, CEX.io processes most credit card purchase instantly. Upgrading your account to CEX.io's "Verified" account type can be a long process, but subsequent purchases are quick. 

## Reputation
CEX.io is a registered company and/or money transmitter in all districts in which it does business. In the US, it is registered with FinCEN, while registered with ICO in the UK and EU. 

## Fees
Credit card purchases of Bitcoin are charged 3.9% + $0.25. Purchases made via bank transfer are free.
