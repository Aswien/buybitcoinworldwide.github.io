<h2>What is the Best Bitcoin Wallet?</h2>
<p>There is no best Bitcoin wallet. You'll have to consider your needs. Do you need an iPhone wallet? Secure storage? Will your wallet be used across multiple devices? Ask yourself these questions to determine which wallet will be best for you.</p>
	
<h2>Best Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Overviews</h2>			
<p>A Bitcoin hardware wallet is a physical Bitcoin wallet that is built with the sole purpose of securing Bitcoin private keys. Hardware Bitcoin wallets keep private keys away from internet-connected devices and allow users to sign transactions in an offline environment. Hardware wallets are considered the most secure Bitcoin wallet along with paper wallets.</p>
