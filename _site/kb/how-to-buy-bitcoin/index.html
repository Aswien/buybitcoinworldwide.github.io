It may seem complicated, but by the end you’ll understand 1) <a href="/where-to-buy-bitcoins/">where to buy bitcoins</a> 2) how to <a href="/find-exchange/">find the right exchange</a> 3) where to store your bitcoins after you buy and 4) mistakes to avoid when buying.</p> <p>Each Bitcoin buyer has different needs. There is no “best Bitcoin exchange”. For example, if you need a large amount of bitcoins than an exchange with high limits and liquidity is essential. If you need to buy bitcoins privately, then methods like ATM or cash deposit, where no personal information is required, may be better. The next three sections will explain what factors must be considered. </p> <h2 id="types-of-exchanges">Types of Exchanges</h2> <p>There are different kinds of Bitcoin exchanges. Some exchanges require you to meet a seller in person, and some exchanges allow you to buy online. </p> <p><img src="/img/icons/exchange.png" alt="how to buy bitcoin" class="img-responsive halfimg-right" /></p> <p><strong>Broker –</strong> Bitcoin brokers sell bitcoin for a fixed price. Brokers often have high limits and can accept many <a href="/en/payment-methods/">payment methods</a>. In most cases brokers will require personal information and identity verification before you can buy bitcoins. <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase" rel="nofollow">Coinbase</a> is the world’s largest Bitcoin broker. </p> <p><strong>Exchange –</strong> Bitcoin exchanges don’t sell bitcoin, but match buyers and sellers. For example, say someone wants to sell one bitcoin for $300. The seller puts in a sell order for $300. When a buyer agrees to pay $300, the seller will receive $300 and the buyer of the bitcoin receives the one bitcoin. Some of the largest Bitcoin exchanges are <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/">BitStamp</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, and <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/">BitFinex</a>. </p> <p><strong>Peer-to-peer (P2P) Exchanges –</strong> Exchanges like <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins" rel="nofollow">LocalBitcoins</a> are escrow services that simply match users. Buyers and sellers are free to agree on a price and payment method, and LocalBitcoins ensures that neither party is scammed by holding the payments in escrow until the trade is complete. Other examples of P2P exchanges include <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buybitquick" rel="nofollow">BitQuick</a>. </p> <p><strong>ATMs –</strong> Bitcoin ATMs let you buy bitcoin with cash. You simply insert cash into the machine, and get bitcoins sent to your wallet. Some ATMs require personal information. Use <a href="http://coinatmradar.com/">Coin ATM Radar</a> to find a Bitcoin ATM near you. </p> <h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to Consider</h2> <p>The idea of a Bitcoin ATM may sound nice. But, did you know that most Bitcoin ATMs charge fees in excess of 7%? Because of this, it’s important to consider the following when finding an exchange:</p> <p><strong>Privacy –</strong> If you need to buy bitcoins privately, you can already cross off a number of payment methods: bank transfer, credit card, PayPal, or any other method that requires personal or identifying information. ATMs and P2P exchanges like <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins" rel="nofollow">LocalBitcoins</a> or <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buybitquick" rel="nofollow">BitQuick</a> are the more private methods of buying bitcoin. </p> <p><img src="/img/icons/pmethod.png" alt="consider" class="img-responsive halfimg-right" /></p> <p><strong>Amount –</strong> If you need to buy a large amount of bitcoins then you’ll have to look at big brokers or exchanges, like <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase" rel="nofollow">Coinbase</a> or <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/" rel="nofollow">BitStamp</a>. These exchanges handle high volumes and offer lots of liquidity. </p> <p><strong>Speed –</strong> How fast do you need access to your bitcoins? Do you need to <a href="/kb/buy-bitcoin-instantly/">buy bitcoin instantly</a>? Bitcoin ATMs can be the fastest way to buy bitcoin if you’re lucky enough to have one in your area. P2P options like <a href="https://www.bitquick.co/">BitQuick</a> or <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">LocalBitcoins</a> can be a good way to buy small amounts fast. Some brokers, like <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase" rel="nofollow">Coinbase</a> and <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buy_circle" rel="nofollow">Circle</a>, offer instant buys with bank transfer, credit card, or debit card. </p> <p><strong>Exchange Rate</strong> – There is no official Bitcoin price. Bitcoin exchanges are used to get an accurate idea of the price of bitcoin. So, naturally, Bitcoin exchanges usually have the best exchange rate. Bitcoin brokers buy bitcoin from exchanges and sell them. So, while Bitcoin brokers will generally offer you a price close to that of Bitcoin exchanges, there will usually be an additional fee. Use <a href="http://bitcoinaverage.com/">BitcoinAverage</a> or <a href="http://coindesk.com/price">CoinDesk</a> to see the average price of Bitcoin. </p> <p><strong>Reputation</strong> – How long has the exchange been in service? Is the exchange trustworthy? Our <a href="/exchanges/">Bitcoin exchange reviews</a> can help you find a trusted exchange. </p> <p><strong>Location –</strong> Does the Bitcoin exchange offer service in your country? P2P exchanges like <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins" rel="nofollow">LocalBitcoins</a> work in most countries, while most other services are limited to certain countries. </p> <p><strong>Fees –</strong> How much does the exchange charge for its services? ATMs have the highest fees at about 7% per transaction. Brokers and P2P exchanges usually charge a flat fee of around 1%. Exchanges generally have the lowest fees at about 0.2-0.5% per trade. </p> <p><strong>Payment Method –</strong> How can you pay for the bitcoins? We cover this in depth in the next section.</p> <h2 id="payment-methods">Payment Methods</h2> <p>In order to buy bitcoins, you’ll need to exchange your local currency, like the dollar or euro, for bitcoin. Here’s an overview of the most common payment methods: </p> <p><strong>Credit or Debit Card –</strong> Credit card is the most common form of payment today, but not a good way to buy bitcoins. Most places that let you buy bitcoins with a credit card charge higher fees due to the higher risk of fraud with credit card payments. <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coinbase</a> and <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buy_circle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Circle</a> charge 3% on all credit card purchases, and some brokers charge up to 10%. Buying bitcoins with a credit cards offers no privacy, since the exchange can connect your bitcoin purchase to your credit card information. A few places to buy bitcoins with a credit card are: <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buy_circle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Circle</a> (U.S. only), and <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/CoinMama_Bitcoin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coinmama</a> (global). </p> <p><strong>Bank Transfer –</strong> This is one of the best ways to buy bitcoins in most countries. Bank transfers often let users buy bitcoin in larger amounts. As with credit cards, this is not a good option for users in need of privacy. <a href="/find-exchange/">Use our tool</a> to find an exchange in your country that accepts bank transfer. </p> <p><img src="/img/icons/sepa.png" alt="cash" class="img-responsive halfimg-right" /></p> <p><strong>Cash Deposit –</strong> Cash deposit is often one of the fastest ways to buy bitcoin. Services like <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/buybitquick" rel="nofollow">BitQuick</a> often deliver your bitcoins within a couple hours. Cash deposit lets you buy bitcoins privately because no personal information is required. Use <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins" rel="nofollow">LocalBitcoins</a> or BitQuick to buy bitcoin with cash deposit. LocalBitcoins offers helpful a <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoins">first time buyer’s guide</a> for first new users.</p> <p><strong>Bitcoin ATMs –</strong> There are many companies that make Bitcoin ATMs, and each model has different features. For example, some Bitcoin ATMs simply let you insert cash and get bitcoins, without identity verification. This is a good way to buy bitcoin privately. Some ATMs require a picture of a government issued ID and a fingerprint scan. The downside to buying bitcoin from a Bitcoin ATM is that most Bitcoin ATMs have high markups on both the buy and sell side (usually 3-7%). However, this is the price people are willing to pay to buy bitcoins privately. Keep in mind that ATMs often have lower buy limits. Use <a href="http://coinatmradar.com/">Coin ATM Radar</a> to find a Bitcoin ATM near you. </p> <p><strong>PayPal –</strong> There is no way to <a href="/en/buy-bitcoin-paypal/">directly buy bitcoins with PayPal</a>. Under PayPal’s terms and conditions merchants are not allowed to sell bitcoins for PayPal. However, there are a few hacks to get around this. You can buy other digital items with PayPal and sell those items for bitcoin. For example, at <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/bitcoin_virwox" rel="nofollow">VirWoX</a> you can buy Second Life Lindens, another digital currency, and exchange the Lindens for bitcoin. Keep in mind that buying bitcoin with PayPal usually comes with an even higher markup than Bitcoin ATMs or credit cards and is not recommended. </p> <h2 id="find-an-exchange">Find an Exchange</h2> <p>Now that you have a better idea of what kind of exchange you need, it’s time to find one! </p> <p><img src="/img/icons/findexchange.png" alt="how to buy bitcoin" class="img-responsive halfimg-right" /></p> <p>In Bitcoin’s early years, there were only a few exchanges in Asia. Today, most developed countries have at least one Bitcoin exchange. The ease of buying bitcoin in your country will depend on how developed your country is. For example, countries like the <a href="/en/us/">United States</a>, <a href="/en/gb/">United Kingdom</a>, and <a href="/en/ca/">Canada</a> have many Bitcoin exchanges, while countries like Ethiopia have no local exchange. </p> <p>You can use our tool to <a href="/find-exchange/">find an exchange in your country</a>. </p> <h2 id="find-a-wallet">Find a Wallet</h2> <p>Now that you’re on your way to buying bitcoins, <a href="/kb/what-is-a-bitcoin-wallet/">you need to get a Bitcoin wallet</a>. Obtaining a Bitcoin wallet is the first step to using Bitcoin. Without a wallet, you can’t receive, store, or spend bitcoins. </p> <p><img src="/img/icons/wallet1.png" alt="bitcoin wallet" class="img-responsive halfimg-right" /></p> <p>One of the most basic rules when using Bitcoin is to make sure you have control over your bitcoins. When you buy bitcoin on an exchange, it’s usually possible to leave your bitcoins on the exchange without moving them to a wallet you own. However, we strongly recommend against this. The only way to truly own bitcoins and make sure they are secured properly is to store them in a wallet that you own!</p> <p>The wallet you should use depends on your needs. Users in need of secure, long term storage should use a paper wallet, or a hardware wallet like <a href="/wallets/trezor/">TREZOR</a> or <a href="/wallets/ledger-nano/">Ledger Nano</a>. If you intend to make frequent Bitcoin transactions, a hot wallet is slightly less secure but better for day-to-day transactions. Read our guide on <a href="/kb/how-to-store-and-protect-bitcoins/">how to store bitcoins</a> for more details. It’s up to you to decide which wallet fits your needs. </p> <p>Before you <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-can-i-buy-bitcoins/" target="_blank">buy bitcoins</a>: have a plan, secure your bitcoins, and don’t store them with third parties! If the whole idea of a Bitcoin wallet is still confusing, <a href="/kb/what-is-a-bitcoin-wallet/">read our post</a> on Bitcoin wallets. </p> <h2 id="things-to-remember">Things to Remember</h2> <p>Understand these basic principles in order to prevent yourself from losing money: </p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Control your coins.</strong> Don’t leave bitcoins on an exchange. Some exchanges, like Circle and Coinbase, allow you to buy and sell bitcoin, but also provide “wallet” services. However, these wallets don’t give you full control of your bitcoins and act more like banks. As we mentioned earlier, don’t store your bitcoins on these exchanges, even if the exchange offers a wallet service. Buy your bitcoins, and move them to a wallet you control. For long term, secure storage, use a paper wallet or hardware wallet like TREZOR or Ledger.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Don’t store bitcoins in a hot wallet.</strong> We recommend the above wallets for secure storage, because wallets used on your phone or computer may be vulnerable to hackers. Wallets on your phone or computer are fine for small, day-to-day amounts and spending, but not for large amounts of funds.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Understand how to send and receive bitcoins.</strong> Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. If you send bitcoins to the wrong address, you won’t get them back. </p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="when-is-the-right-time-to-buy">When is the Right Time to Buy?</h2> <p>As with any market, nothing is for sure. Throughout its history Bitcoin has increased in value at a very fast pace, followed by a slow, steady downfall. Use tools like <a href="https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd">Bitcoin Wisdom</a> or <a href="https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd">Cryptowatch</a> to analyze charts and understand Bitcoin’s price history.</p> <h2 id="why-does-buying-bitcoin-take-so-long">Why does Buying Bitcoin take so long?</h2> <p>Long wait times are usually a problem with existing payment systems, not with Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions only take about 10 minutes to confirm. But, bank transfers in the U.S. can take up to five days to complete. This means a merchant can’t realease bitcoins to a customer until five days have passed unless they are willing to take on risk. </p> <h2 id="how-to-avoid-scams">How to Avoid Scams</h2> <p>There are many scams related to Bitcoin. These scammers target new Bitcoiners and less tech-savvy users. Follow these basic rules in order to <a href="/kb/avoid-bitcoin-scams/">avoid Bitcoin scams</a>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Research</strong> Once you find an exchange, research the exchange and make sure it’s trustworthy. Check forums like Reddit to see the experience of other users. You can also use our <a href="/exchanges/">Bitcoin exchange reviews</a> to get in depth information about each exchange. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Check ratings</strong> If you’re using a P2P exchange like LocalBitcoins or BitQuick, check the seller’s feedback. If most of their feedback is positive, your trade is more likely to go through without issues. If a seller has lots of negative feedback, it’s best to simply stay away and find a different seller. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Use escrow.</strong> Many scammers will try something like this: “send me bitcoins, and once I get the bitcoins I’ll pay you on PayPal!” Don’t ever to agree to a trade like this. Because bitcoin payments are irreversible, the scammer won’t send you PayPal and this leaves you with no way to get your bitcoins back. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow">Escrow services</a> can help prevent scams. An escrow service holds bitcoins until both parties agree that the trade is completed. Services like BitQuick and LocalBitcoins are escrow services that can help you buy bitcoin and avoid scams. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bitcoin investments.</strong> Any service that claims to pay interest on bitcoins or increase your bitcoins is likely a scam. If it sounds too good to be true, stay away. </p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="physical-bitcoins">Physical Bitcoins</h2> <p><img src="/img/icons/paypal.png" alt="physical bitcoins" class="img-responsive halfimg-right" /></p> <p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/10-physical-bitcoins-good-bad-ugly/">Physical bitcoins</a> are physical, metal coins with a Bitcoin private key embedded inside. While this sounds like a good idea, you must trust the creator of the physical bitcoin. The creator could create two copies <a href="/kb/what-is-a-bitcoin-private-key/">of the private key</a>. The creator could keep one for himself, and give one to you. If you intend to save your physical bitcoin, the creator could at anytime steal the funds and leave you with nothing. It’s best to stay way from physical bitcoins.</p> <h2 id="move-your-bitcoins">Move your Bitcoins</h2> <p>Now that you understand how to buy bitcoin, it’s time to move them into your wallet. Read our guide on <a href="/kb/how-to-store-and-protect-bitcoins/">storing bitcoins</a> to ensure that your bitcoins will be safe and secure. Bitcoin may be hard to understand, but it’s important to take the time to learn if you’re serious about using Bitcoin. </p> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2> <p>All of this may sound confusing, but, don’t worry. Once you understand the basics and buy bitcoin for the first time, it’ll be easy for you to make future purchases.
