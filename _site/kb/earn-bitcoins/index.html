While buying bitcoins is the quickest way to get them, it’s not always the most cost-effective. Earning bitcoins instead of buying bitcoins can save a lot of money, if you have the time for it.</p> <p>Fortunately it’s fairly easy to earn bitcoins online; if you can earn fiat, you can earn bitcoins. All that’s required to earn a decent wage in Bitcoin is a marketable skill or product, combined with the knowledge made available in this guide.</p> <h2 id="automatic-salary-conversion-to-bitcoin">Automatic Salary Conversion to Bitcoin</h2> <p>If you draw a salary in fiat, nothing prevents you from <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/find-exchange/">purchasing Bitcoin from your local exchange via the most convenient payment method.</a> However, it can become tiresome to repeat this process every month, week or whenever you’re paid.</p> <p>Several services exist which automatically convert a portion of your wage or salary to Bitcoin:</p> <p><a href="https://www.bitwage.com/"><strong>1. Bitwage</strong></a> - this service is available for employees and freelancers in the USA, although expansion to new regions is planned.

Users only need to add <em>Bitwage’s corporate account as a secondary bank account with their employer.</em></p> <p><img src="/img/earn/bitwage.png" alt="bitwage" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> <p><a href="https://bitpay.com/payroll"><strong>2. Payroll</strong></a> - the competitor service to Bitwage, offered as a service by the well-known payments company, BitPay. Payroll has very similar features to Bitwage and is also restricted to the USA at present.</p> <p><a href="http://www.getpaidinbitcoin.com.au/"><strong>3. Get Paid in Bitcoin</strong></a> - a variation on the above services for workers in Australia.</p> <h2 id="find-bitcoin-paying-work-on-job-boards">Find Bitcoin-Paying Work on Job Boards</h2> <p>Coding skills are in high demand in this sector, particularly for those who’ve mastered Bitcoin. Other skills which translate well to the internet (such as website creation, graphic design, writing, journalism, translation, video production, etc.) are also highly sought-after. Just about any useful service can earn Bitcoin however, so don’t be discouraged if your talents lie elsewhere.</p> <p>Once you land a job, it’s advised to request an escrowed payment from any new employer. This is especially important for tasks demanding a considerable time commitment.</p> <p>If you’re looking for jobs which pay in bitcoins, these sites offer some of the best listings:</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4bitcoins"><strong>4. Reddit’s Jobs4Bitcoins</strong></a> - this informal job board allows you to advertise your services and view a modest range of job offers.
