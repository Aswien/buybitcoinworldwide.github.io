Simply put, money is a tool for trade. Without this tool, the only form of trade possible is barter. This is a severely limited form of exchange however. For example, let’s consider a blacksmith who wants bread for breakfast. He could produce a spatula to exchange with the baker but problems arise. If it costs the baker only a little flour, some firewood and a few minutes of kneading to produce a loaf, whereas crafting a spatula costs the blacksmith in rare steel and an hour of hard labor, then clearly the blacksmith would demand a great many loaves in exchange. Yet, the blacksmith wouldn’t be able to consume so much bread before it went stale. And what if the baker already had a spatula? These obvious problems and limitations are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the deficiencies of barter. Money has value precisely because it solves all these trade problems. </p> <p>Money may take any form which meets general consensus. Everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yap#Stone_money" rel="nofollow">gigantic stone disks</a> to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/03/14/pilfered-tide-detergent-new-drug-currency" rel="nofollow">Tide detergent</a> to seashells has been employed in a monetary role. Nowadays, we mostly use central bank-issued physical coins, notes and electronic money. These are the forms which hold the widest consensus and are therefore most useful for trade – money which nobody will accept for trade is not money at all. Yet it must be recognized that this consensus arises not from free choice but is rather imposed by governments. Legally, taxes must be paid in such money and it cannot be refused as payment. Money whose consensus (and therefore value) is a matter of decree is referred to as “fiat,” <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fiat" rel="nofollow">defined</a> as “a command or act of will that creates something without or as if without further effort.” </p> <p>Given the choice, there are several criteria according to which markets would decide upon the best form of money. These criteria are based upon the principles of no less a thinker than Aristotle. To explain why bitcoins are valuable, we must measure them against these criteria and see how they stack up against competing monetary forms. The criteria are as follows:</p> <h2 id="durability-moneys-form-must-persist-over-time">1) Durability: money’s form must persist over time</h2> <p>Gold, a metal immune to rusting, is extremely physical durable. As any treasure hunter knows, it survives even at the bottom of the ocean for centuries.</p> <p>Fiat cannot be said to be durable as it is periodically re-issued in new forms, as when German Marks were replaced by Euros. Paper notes are also easily burnt, water-damaged or torn.</p> <p>Bitcoins, given the continued existence and compatibility of the network, can be made even more persistent than gold by carving their “access details” into a substance like titanium. However, these details may also be copied infinitely. Thus your bitcoins are as persistent as you trouble yourself to make them.</p> <h2 id="limited-supply">2) Limited supply</h2> <p>As money is a trade good, like all goods it’s subject to the laws of supply and demand. Abundant supply will lower its price and raise the price of everything else as consequence. Scarcity will cause money to be worth money, otherwise known as deflation or falling prices.</p> <p>As it is hard work to extract from the ground, gold’s value is historically stable. An ounce of gold bought a fine toga and sandals in ancient Rome and buys a fine suit and shoes today. The only exceptions to this stability were short-term, such as when conquering armies returned with vast loot or galleons laden with gold returned from the New World to the Old. The subsequent glut of gold, used then as currency, inevitably led to rocketing prices. In modern times, the quantity of gold on the planet is known and fixed. One would have to mine asteroids or other planets to inflate the supply and so lower its value.</p> <p>By dint of its unlimited supply, fiat is a terrible store of value. Its value is steadily diluted as it’s inflated, which is to say, issued in ever-increasing quantity by the banking system. An American Dollar, for example, was worth 24 times more a century ago and the Zimbabwean Dollar’s value went to zero over a decade.</p> <p>Bitcoin’s issuance is limited to 21 million full coins, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto" rel="nofollow">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> designed Bitcoin with gold as his model. Bitcoin is still too new and experimental to have established a steady value however. In fact, its volatile price probably remains as the biggest barrier to commercial use, although it must be said that this volatility is noticeably decreasing over time. Price has been remarkably stable (for Bitcoin) since February 2015. Bitcoin’s market cap remains relatively modest, around the level of $4 billion. In order to accommodate mass adoption or fully accommodate financial services such as remittance or inter-bank settlements, Bitcoin’s price would have to rise by at least one order of magnitude. As such, Bitcoin’s price remains in a speculative rather than stable phase.</p> <h2 id="portability">3) Portability</h2> <p>A few slices of bread may be valuable to a hungry blacksmith but try carrying enough of them to buy a house! Value by size and weight is therefore an important consideration. </p> <p>A decent amount of value is concentrated into gold’s mass, making it a reasonable form of cash except for high value trades where its size and weight becomes an issue. Distant transfers of gold are slow and incur expensive shipping and security costs. </p> <p>Fiat, in comparison to gold, is far lighter to carry as cash while being quicker and cheaper to send electronically. Any amount of money may be transferred around the world, usually within days, for a minor percentage and / or flat fee. The only catch is that fiat may only be sent to someone with a bank account in a country on peaceful terms with your own.</p> <p>Bitcoin outperforms all previous forms of currency in this regard, as it may be reliably sent around the world in 30 minutes to an hour, at negligible cost. Bitcoin may also be sent to absolutely anyone running the software and connected to the internet, without fear of interdiction. </p> <h2 id="divisibility">4) Divisibility</h2> <p>It’s important that money be easily divisible, so that it may be used for trades big or small. </p> <p>Fiat cash is divided into various denominations for this reason. The standard two decimal places, usually known as “cents” allow for minor sums to be traded. A gold coin is not easily divided for minor trades and it’s for this reason that silver and copper coins were also used. </p> <p>Bitcoin wins in this category however, as it may be divided down to eight decimal places. The atomic unit in this system is known as a Satoshi and is represented thus: 0.00000001 BTC. Such fractional amounts make new business models, based on micro-transactions, viable.</p> <h2 id="fungibility">5) Fungibility</h2> <p>Another important characteristic of money is that any one unit be exactly alike to another. </p> <p>So, the gold content of a coin must be tested (the reason you may have seen people biting coins in movies) to ensure its equivalence to a standard. This makes gold either inconvenient or trust-dependent for practical trade.</p> <p>Fiat cash is fungible but <a href="https://mises.org/library/international-war-cash" rel="nofollow">increasingly difficult</a> to trade in larger amounts. The electronic version may be traced with relative ease between accounts and seized if deemed to be the proceeds of illegal activity. It is for this reason that criminals will pay double digit percentages to “launder” their money, in effect restoring its fungibility so that they might safely use it within the regular economy. </p> <p>Bitcoin wins again here, being entirely fungible. The only exception is when trading bitcoins through large, centralized exchanges. These services track a coin’s history, and you are liable to have your account closed if your coins are linked to illegal activities. Trust-less solutions, such as <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=919116.0" rel="nofollow">Joinmarket</a>, are being developed to ensure Bitcoin’s fungibility going forward.</p> <h2 id="intrinsic-value">6) Intrinsic Value</h2> <p>Gold has value in and of itself due to its scarcity, beauty, extraction cost (mining being an expensive endeavor) and the natural hedge it presents to fiat money. Thus gold is the canonical example of this quality. </p> <p>Fiat money holds value due to the government saying it does (and holding the power to back this statement) and the majority of citizens accepting this statement. This popular consensus by which a product’s value rises is known as the network effect. </p> <p>Bitcoin’s intrinsic value is harder to establish. Its value is vastly superior to that of the entire collection of “altcoins” (alternative cryptocurrencies based upon Satoshi’s innovations) due to the previously mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect" rel="nofollow">network effect</a>. It’s also strictly limited at the code level, in direct contrast to fiat which may be created at will by politicians and bankers. Provided you hold the private key to your Bitcoin wallet, you needn’t trust a third party to hold your wealth. Bitcoin also has a reasonably high extraction cost, measured in the price of electricity and specialized computing hardware required to “<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining" rel="nofollow">mine</a>” it. </p> <p>The current value of Bitcoin is ultimately derived from two market factors: the belief that it constitutes a sound and technologically superior form of money and the speculative view that Bitcoin will expand to replace existing financial services (such as Western Union) and potentially even entire fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s value is thus a consensus among all market participants as to its current and future utility as a monetary system.</p> <p>By considering the above categories and contrasting Bitcoin against competing monetary forms, it soon becomes apparent why this new form of cryptographic money is worth so much and likely to be worth more in the future. It’s durable, limited in supply and extremely portable, divisible and fungible. Bitcoin combines many of the best features of gold and fiat, with the only major drawback being price volatility due to its experimental nature. It’s likely that the price of Bitcoin will either be significantly higher in ten years or be zero. </p> <div class="share-page"> Share on: <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why Bitcoin is
