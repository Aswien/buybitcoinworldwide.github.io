**Hive Wallet is officially unsupported and will not receive further development.**  

Hive is an elegant, HD [Bitcoin wallet](/wallets/) available on the web, iPhone, and Android. It aims to be ‘human-friendly’, allows you control private keys, and offers basic send and receive features. Hive also supports Litecoin.

A 12-word seed is generated upon wallet creation. The seed can be imported to Hive’s web wallet if the original wallet was made on Android/iOS, and vice-versa.

Hive offers a feature called ‘Waggle’, which, using your geo-location, scans for other Hive users within 1 kilometer of your location. Payments can then be sent by clicking on a name of users near your location.

##Security
{: .security .wallet-sections}
A mobile wallet is only as secure as the device it’s running on. Hive encrypts all data and keys. An unrooted (Android)/non-jailbroken (iOS) device should be used.

A 12-word seed is generated on account creation. This seed is an account backup; all addresses and funds can be restored with it.

A pin must be made on wallet creation, and is required upon opening the app or logging in.

##Privacy
{: .privacy .wallet-sections}
As an HD wallet, Hive generates a new address for every transaction and does not re-use addresses. Using a new address for each transaction helps prevent spying on your payments and funds.
