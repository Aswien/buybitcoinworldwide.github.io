People buy bitcoin for a number of different reasons. Bitcoin is global, borderless money that has given the world more financial freedom. 

## Investment 
People view Bitcoin as "digital gold". Many believe its scarcity and utility will make it worth many times its current value in the future. Bitcoin’s supply can’t be inflated, as its 21 million cap is built into the code. This means that governments and other third parties can’t alter the supply. 

## Buying Online
In many cases customers can save money by using bitcoin over other payment methods. Merchants save money by accepting Bitcoin instead of credit cards, which can save them 2-3% on each transaction. These savings are often passed on to customers. 

At [Purse.io](http://buybitcoinww.co/purse_io){:rel="nofollow"} you can use Bitcoin to get a discount of up to 25% on anything from Amazon.com. [Gyft](https://www.gyft.com/){:rel="nofollow"} is a gift card reseller and gives you 3% back on each purchase made with Bitcoin, compared to 2% for PayPal and only 1% with credit or debit card. 

## Security
Bitcoin transactions are “push” transactions, while credit card transactions are “pull” transactions. Every time you swipe your credit card, you must trust that the merchant will keep your card information secure. With Bitcoin, you simply send bitcoin to an address and the merchant receives no other information—only bitcoin. 

## Privacy
Unlike credit cards, your name isn’t attached to your Bitcoin wallet. You can make transactions without sacrificing privacy or exposing your personal information. 

## Financial Freedom
Bitcoin can be stored securely in your home, on a piece of paper, or even as a password in your brain. Bitcoin can’t be confiscated, and you don’t need to trust a bank or third party with your money. 

## Dark Web
The dark web has gotten much bigger over the past few years, and bitcoin is the primary currency used for these transactions. 

## Remittances 
Bitcoin has no borders and can be sent from any device with an internet connection to any other device with an internet connection. People use Bitcoin to transfer value from country to country.  The bitcoin is then received in the country receiving the remittance, and cashed out to the country’s local currency. Bitcoin remittances usually cost 3% of the total amount, while companies like Western Union charged between 10-15%. 

## Trading
Bitcoin has been extremely volatile for most of its history. Traders buy and sell bitcoin frequently in order to try and cash out on Bitcoin’s price action.

Bitcoin has many advantages over both fiat currencies and other payment systems used today. Bitcoin is an open system and anyone in the world is free to use it in their apps, or build other protocols on top of it. New use cases will continue to pop up as the world experiments with sound and open money.
